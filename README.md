# Mobile basic interaction boilerplate

## Why this stupid name ?

Github helps the developer which has lost his inspiration while working late at night. Thank you Github for this name :)

## Description

Basic skeleton from the main interaction mostly seen in the apps today:
| nav | main view | contextual view |

What’s in:
 * CSS 3 transition to focus aside views (left, right) into main view and vice versa
 * Pull to refresh: TODO
 * infinite list: TODO, probably the worst part.

## Why this skeleton ?

Either to do a quick prototype, or to validate some interaction with a client, or test that it will works in a large browser scope, I mean you still have to support Android 2.2 or 2.3 in some use cases. And at least you should as there is a growing market for countries where old smartphone are widely available. If you need to build an application for Africa, you will need to support as low as Android 2.x.

## Limitation

This boilerplate is only … a boilerplate. It is really made to ease some prototyping, validation or whatever. It is incomplete and will always be. We may want to add some other features, or to create other animations, etc. I encourage anybody interested to make PR. See contributing guide available in CONTRIBUTING.md.
